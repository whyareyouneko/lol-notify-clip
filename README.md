🧭🎥 LoL Notify Clip  

LoL Notify Clip is a lightweight, high-performance Windows tool designed to coach you while you play League of Legends and automatically capture your best moments.  
Why the name?
- 🧭  Notify: Real-time coaching assistant that shows toast notifications based on your gameplay stats (kills, deaths, XP, etc.), with role-specific tips.  
- 🎥 Clip: High-performance recorder that saves your highlights, ensuring you never miss a clutch outplay, a Pentakill, or a Dragon steal.
